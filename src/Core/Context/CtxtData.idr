module Core.Context.CtxtData

-- This module includes context data structures only (we need to reference
-- them in Error messages in Core.Error, and many context operations can
-- also throw errors)

-- Context entries read from TTC files will be stored as Binary, so when
-- we look them up, we have to decode them
